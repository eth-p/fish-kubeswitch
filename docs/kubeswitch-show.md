## User-Defined Metadata

> **Note:** This feature requires [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) version 4 to be installed.

Kubeswitch allows the user to define additional metadata in `.ksi` (kubeswitch information) files. These files should be named the same as the kubeconfig file, but with a `.ksi` file extension. For example, if the config file is named `docker`, kubeswitch will read metadata from `docker.ksi`.

A kubeswitch information file is yaml, where the root keys are compared matched the active environment. The matching maps will be merged in order, with the most-recent value taking precedence.

The following would be an example for the kubeconfig file generated by Docker Desktop:

```yaml
"*@docker-desktop":
  some-key: default value

"kube-system@*":
  some-key: overriden when the namespace is 'kube-system'
```
