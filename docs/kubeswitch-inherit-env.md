# kubeswitch inherit-env

Inherit the `kubeswitch` environment that was most recently set by another instance of fish.

This creates a copy of the last-set environment and applies it to the current instance, saving you the trouble of having to re-run `kubeswitch config`, `kubeswitch context`, and `kubeswitch namespace` in a new split or terminal window.
